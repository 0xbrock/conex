# [conex](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/conex/)
**this addon is still experimental and lacks hiding / showing tab containers due to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1384515**

See the [experiment version](https://github.com/kesselborn/conex#getting-a-version-that-can-really-hide-tabs) in action here: [conex in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTwmIFSnLWY)

This webextension is a replacement for the discontinued <b>TabGroups</b> with some differences:

# Functionality

- it lacks the big "Manage my TabGroups" overview window
- tab groups are implemented via containers
- the quick search containes thumbnail of the results
- the quick search includes bookmarks and history

# Installation

Just install from the [official mozilla addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/conex)

# Getting a version that can really hide tabs

The [mentioned bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1384515) had a [firefox experiment with an api
for hiding & showing tabs](https://github.com/kesselborn/conex/releases/tag/hidetabsexperiment) which makes conex behave as expected.

**Please read**: This works on **FirefoxNightly only** and you must turn off extension signature checking ...
please only proceed if you know what this means:

- in FirefoxNightly open the url `about:config` and acknowledge the warning. Change the following settings:

      xpinstall.signatures.required: false
      extensions.legacy.enabled: true

- install the [hidetabsexperiment.xpi](https://github.com/kesselborn/conex/releases/tag/hidetabsexperiment) -- you need to acknowledge all the warnings
- install the newest 'experiment' release from the [github conex release page](https://github.com/kesselborn/conex/releases) (something like v0.0.75experiment)

# Getting back my last tab group sesssion

So: Firefox Quantum rolled in, tab groups doesn't work anymore and you would like to get back
your last tab groups session? Here is a way you can get a tab groups backup which again you
can import to conex (note: only tested it briefly, but it's worth a try):

- download [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/?q=English%20(US)) (this still supports old extension) and install it
- close Firefox Quantum
- open Firefox ESR
- if you see tab groups in your addon section but it is disabled, please do the following:
    - open the url `about:config` and acknowledge the warning. Change the following settings:

            xpinstall.signatures.required: false

- if you are lucky, your old session is restored and you can just open tab-groups and create a manual backup which you can use as an import for conex
- if your session is not restored, all hope is not lost:
  - go to tab-groups preferences and open the 'Backup / Restore' section
  - click the 'Load Groups and Tabs From ...' button and select 'Previous Session'
  - once imported, create the manual backup now
