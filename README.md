This webextension is a replacement for the discontinued <b>TabGroups</b> with some differences:

# Functionality

- it lacks the big "Manage my TabGroups" overview window
- tab groups are implemented via containers
- the quick search containes thumbnail of the results
- the quick search includes bookmarks and history

# Installation

Just install from the [official mozilla addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/conex)

# Getting a version that can really hide tabs

The [mentioned bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1384515) had a [firefox experiment with an api
for hiding & showing tabs](https://github.com/kesselborn/conex/releases/tag/hidetabsexperiment) which makes conex behave as expected.

**Please read**: This works on **FirefoxNightly only** and you must turn off extension signature checking ...
please only proceed if you know what this means:

- in FirefoxNightly open `about:config` and acknowledge the warning. Change the following settings:

      xpinstall.signatures.required: false
      extensions.legacy.enabled: true

- install the [hidetabsexperiment.xpi](https://github.com/kesselborn/conex/releases/tag/hidetabsexperiment) -- you need to acknowledge all the warnings
- install the newest 'experiment' release from the [github conex release page](https://github.com/kesselborn/conex/releases) (something like v0.0.75experiment)
